# LSTM-CNN-Epilepsy-Prediction-with-EEG
This is my Final Year Project for my Diploma in Engineering Science at Ngee Ann Polytechnic

A Deep Learning method of predicting Epileptic Episodes using a Long Short Term Memory-Convolutional Neutral Network (LSTM-CNN) with Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as input. Trained on the Physionet Dataset using 3750 Positive and 3750 Negative signals.
